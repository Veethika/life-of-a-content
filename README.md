# 🤷🏻‍♀️ What is this exercise all about? 
Ever wonder what happens to your content once you release it under a creative commons license? The music, art, writings, videos and other artefacts that you put out into the world takes so many beautiful forms overtime when other creators add their own creativity on top of it by reusing or remixing them with more goodness. But this could be a very slow process and that makes it difficult for you to notice this metamorphosis in action. In this workshop, we would try to run the same process at an accelerated speed so you get to witness this transition up close and live.

### 👩🏻‍💻 Let's get started 
The activity would start off with participants generating their own content, assigning a CC license to them and putting them in the xx folder within this repository. The artifacts would be on display for the duration of the event for everyone to reuse, remix and create something new keeping in mind the associated license. Towards the end, in a debriefing session, the creators would be asked to share their initial expectations and their evolvement. 


### 📜 Which CC licenses would be covered?

If you wish to combine two works, try to check in the image below the intersection of the licenses of the respective files. If you see a checkmark there, go ahead and do it. And for the final outcome, use the most restrictive license out of the two.
